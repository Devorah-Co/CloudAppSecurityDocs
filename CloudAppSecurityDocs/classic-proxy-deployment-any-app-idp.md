# Classic portal: Deploy Conditional Access App Control for custom apps with non-Microsoft identity providers

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/classic-banner.md)]

Session controls in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps can be configured to work with any web apps. This article describes how to onboard and deploy custom line-of-business apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premises apps hosted via the Microsoft Entra application proxy with session controls. It provides steps to route app sessions from other IdP solutions to Defender for Cloud Apps. For Microsoft Entra ID, see [Deploy Conditional Access App Control for custom apps using Microsoft Entra ID](classic-proxy-deployment-any-app.md).

Access and session controls in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps work with applications from the Cloud app catalog and with custom applications.

    ![Screenshot showing gather identity provider information page.](media/classic-proxy-deploy-add-idp-get-conf.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > These steps may differ slightly depending on your identity provider. This step is recommended for the following reasons:
    >
    > - Some identity providers do not allow you to change the SAML attributes or URL properties of a gallery app
    > - Configuring a custom app enables you to test this application with access and session controls without changing the existing behavior for your organization.

1. On the next page, fill out the form using the information from your app's single sign-on configuration page, and then select **Next**.
    - If your IdP provides a single sign-on metadata file for the selected app, select **Upload metadata file from the app** and upload the metadata file.
    - Or, select **Fill in data manually** and provide the following information:
        - **Assertion consumer service URL**
        - If your app provides a SAML certificate, select **Use <app_name> SAML certificate** and upload the certificate file.

    ![Screenshot showing enter identity provider information page.](media/classic-proxy-deploy-add-idp-enter-conf.png)

1. On the next page, copy the following information, and then select **Next**. You'll need the information in the next step.

    - Single sign-on URL

        > Some providers may refer to the single sign-on URL as the *Reply URL*.
    1. Add the attributes and values you made a note of earlier to the app's properties.
        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > - Some providers may refer to them as *User attributes* or *Claims*.
        > - When creating a new SAML app, the Okta Identity Provider limits attributes to 1024 characters. To mitigate this limitation, first create the app without the relevant attributes. After creating the app, edit it, and then add the relevant attributes.

    1. Verify that the name identifier is in the email address format.
    1. Save your settings.

    ![Conditional access app control discovered Microsoft Entra apps.](media/classic-caac-discovered-aad-apps.png)

### To add domains for an app<a name="add-domains"></a>

Associating the correct domains to an app allows Defender for Cloud Apps to enforce policies and audit activities.

For example, if you've configured a policy that blocks downloading files for an associated domain, file downloads by the app from that domain will be blocked. However, file downloads by the app from domains not associated with the app won't be blocked and the action won't be audited in the activity log.
> [!NOTE]
> Defender for Cloud Apps still adds a suffix to domains not associated with the app to ensure a seamless user experience.

1. From within the app, on the Defender for Cloud Apps admin toolbar, select **Discovered domains**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The admin toolbar is only visible to users with permissions to onboard or maintenance apps.
1. In the Discovered domains panel, make a note of domain names or export the list as a .csv file.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The panel displays a list of discovered domains that are not associated in the app. The domain names are fully qualified.
1. Go to Defender for Cloud Apps, in the menu bar, select the settings cog ![settings icon 2.](media/classic-settings-icon.png "settings icon 2") and select **Conditional Access App Control**.
1. In the list of apps, on the row in which the app you're deploying appears, choose the three dots at the end of the row, and then under **APP DETAILS**, choose **Edit**.
    > [!TIP]
    > To view the list of domains configured in the app, select **View app domains**.
1. In **User-defined domains**, enter all the domains you want to associate with this app, and then select **Save**.
    > [!NOTE]
    > You can use the * wildcard character as a placeholder for any character. When adding domains, decide whether you want to add specific domains (`sub1.contoso.com`,`sub2.contoso.com`) or multiple domains (`*.contoso.com`).

### Install root certificates<a name="install-certs"></a>

1. Repeat the following steps to install the **Current CA** and **Next CA** self-signed root certificates.
    1. Select the certificate.
    1. Select **Open**, and when prompted select **Open** again.
    1. Select **Install certificate**.
    1. Choose either **Current User** or **Local Machine**.
    1. Select **Place all certificates in the following store** and then select **Browse**.
    1. Select **Trusted Root Certificate Authorities** and then select **OK**.
    1. Select **Finish**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For the certificates to be recognized, once you have installed the certificate, you must restart the browser and go to the same page.

1. Select **Continue**.
1. Check that the application is available in the table.

    ![Check if app is available in table.](media/classic-available-apps.png)

## Step 3: Verify that the app is working correctly<a name="verify-app"></a>

To verify that the application is being proxied, first perform either a hard sign-out of browsers associated with the application or open a new browser with incognito mode.

Open the application and perform the following checks:

- Check that the URL contains the `.mcas` suffix
- Visit all pages within the app that are part of a user's work process and verify that the pages render correctly.
- Verify that the behavior and functionality of the app isn't adversely affected by performing common actions such as downloading and uploading files.
- Review the list of domains associated with the app. For more information, see [Add the domains for the app](#add-domains).

If you encounter errors or issues, use the admin toolbar to gather resources such as `.har` files and recorded sessions for filing a support ticket.

## Step 4: Enable the app for use in your organization<a name="enable-app"></a>

Once you're ready to enable the app for use in your organization's production environment, do the following steps.

1. In Defender for Cloud Apps, select the settings cog ![settings icon 3.](media/classic-settings-icon.png), and then select **Conditional Access App Control**.
1. In the list of apps, on the row in which the app you're deploying appears, choose the three dots at the end of the row, and then choose **Edit app**.
1. Select **Use with Conditional Access App Control** and then select **Save**.
