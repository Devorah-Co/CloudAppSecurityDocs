# Classic portal: Information protection policies

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/classic-banner.md)]

Defender for Cloud Apps file policies allow you to enforce a wide range of automated processes. Policies can be set to provide information protection, including continuous compliance scans, legal eDiscovery tasks, and DLP for sensitive content shared publicly.

Defender for Cloud Apps can monitor any file type based on more than 20 metadata filters, for example, access level, and file type. For more information, see [File policies](data-protection-policies.md).

## Detect and prevent external sharing of sensitive data

Detect when files with personally identifying information or other sensitive data are stored in a Cloud service and shared with users who are external to your organization that violates your company's security policy and creates a potential compliance breach.

1. On the **Policies** page, create a new **File policy**.

2. Set the filter **Access Level** equals **Public (Internet) / Public / External**.

3. Under **Inspection method**, select **Data Classification Service (DCS)**, and under **Select type** select the type of sensitive information you want DCS to inspect.

4. Configure the **Governance** actions to be taken when an alert is triggered. For example, you can create a governance action that runs on detected file violations in Google Workspace in which you select the option to **Remove external users** and **Remove public access**.

5. Create the file policy.
