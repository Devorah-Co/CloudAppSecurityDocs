## App governance June 2023 release

### App governance is now available as part of the Defender for Cloud Apps license

App governance is now included as part of the [various](/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-get-started) Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps licenses and no longer requires an add-on license. 

In the Microsoft Defender Portal, go to  **Settings > Cloud apps > App governance > Service status** to either enable app governance if available or sign up for the waitlist. 

Existing holders of trial licenses for the app governance add-on have until **July 31, 2023** to enable the toggle and retain their app governance access. 

For more information, see [Turn on app governance for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](app-governance-get-started.md).

### App governance OAuth convergence

For customers who have enabled app governance, we have consolidated monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities for all OAuth apps in app governance.

In the Microsoft Defender Portal, we've merged all capabilities originally under **Cloud apps > OAuth apps** under the **App governance** page, where you can manage all OAuth apps under a single pane of glass.

For more information, see [View your apps](app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps.md).

### Enhanced hunting experience for OAuth app activities

App governance now makes it easy for you to take hunting with app data to the next level! App governance now provides deeper OAuth app insights, helping your SOC identify an app’s activities and the resources it has accessed.

OAuth app insights include:

- Out-of-the-box queries that help to streamline the investigation
- Visibility into the data using the results view
- The ability to include OAuth app data such as resource, app, user, and app activity details in custom detections.

For more information, see [Hunt for threats in app activities](app-activity-threat-hunting.md).

### App hygiene feature update

Starting on June 1, 2023, management of unused apps, unused credentials, and expiring credentials is only available to app governance customers with Microsoft Entra Workload ID Premium.

For more information, see [Secure apps with app hygiene features](app-governance-secure-apps-app-hygiene-features.md) and [What are workload identities?](/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identities-overview).

## App governance March 2023 release

- **App hygiene public preview:** App governance now provides insights and policy capability for unused apps, apps with unused credentials, and apps with expiring credentials. Each of these features has a predefined policy out of the box and you can define your own custom policies as well. You can export these insights from the apps list for easy reporting and triage across your organization. 

## App governance February 2023 release

- **Enhanced alert investigation experience:** App governance now provides additional information admins need to investigate and remediate incidents and alerts. This enhancement includes more details under **What happened** and **Recommended actions** in the alert story on Microsoft Defender XDR alert pages. This information is available for all app governance alerts, including alerts triggered by threat detection rules, predefined policies, and user-defined policies. [Learn more about the enhanced alert experience.](/defender-cloud-apps/app-governance-detect-remediate-detect-threats)
- **App Governance app hygiene features public preview:** App Governance insights and controls on unused apps, apps with unused credentials, and apps with expiring credentials launched to public preview on February 15, 2023. Admins can sort, filter, and export on app last used date, credentials unused since, and credentials expiration date. A predefined policy for unused apps, apps with unused credentials, and apps with expiring credentials comes out of the box.
   
## App governance October 2022 release

- **Added insights and remediation for sensitive content**: App governance provides insights and automated remediation capabilities through predefined and custom policies for apps that access content with Microsoft Purview Information Protection labels. Enterprise admins now have visibility into the workloads that these apps access and whether they access sensitive data in these workloads. With predefined and custom policies, admins are alerted about apps that have attempted to access sensitive data. Moreover, app governance can automatically deactivate noncompliant apps.
- **Expanded coverage to include all non-Graph API apps** - App governance has expanded coverage to secure more apps in your tenant. In addition to OAuth apps that use Microsoft Graph API, app governance now provides visibility and protection for all OAuth apps registered on Microsoft Entra ID.

## App governance July 2022 release

- **Added more predefined policies**: App governance released five more out of the box policies to detect anomalous app behaviors. These policies are activated by default, but you can deactivate them if you choose to. [Learn more here](app-governance-predefined-policies.md)
- **New video library**: App governance created a new library of short videos on features in app governance, how to use them, and info on how to learn more. [Check it out here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyhj1WZ29G66k4F_OZeMkQymRGyqHwZVp)
- **Secure Score integration GA**: Microsoft Secure Score integration with the app governance (AppG) add-on to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps (MDA) has reached general availability. AppG customers now receive recommendations in Secure Score, helping them secure their Microsoft 365 OAuth apps.
   Why is this integration important?
   Secure Score is a representation of an organization's security posture and an entry point to various opportunities to improve that posture. By following Secure Score recommendations, customers improve resilience against known and emerging threats.
   AppG is a security and policy management capability designed for OAuth-enabled apps that access Microsoft 365 data. With deep integration into workloads and threat detection capabilities, AppG is well-suited to significantly reduce large attack surfaces in enterprise app ecosystems. By following AppG-related recommendations and enabling proposed policy settings, enterprises can protect both apps and data from misuse and actual bad actor activity.

## App governance May 2022 release

- **Predefined policies GA**: App governance released a set of out of the box policies to detect anomalous app behaviors. These policies are activated by default, but you can deactivate them if you choose to. [Learn more here](app-governance-predefined-policies.md)
- **Teams workload GA**: App governance added insights, policy capabilities, and governance for the Teams workload. You can see data usage, permissions usage, and create policies on Teams permissions and usage.
- **App governance alerts unified in the M365D alerts and incidents queues**: The app governance alerts queue has been unified with the Microsoft Defender XDR alerts experience and are aggregated into incidents.
