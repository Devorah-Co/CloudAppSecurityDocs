### App governance now available as part of Defender for Cloud Apps license

App governance is now included as part of the [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps licenses](app-governance-get-started.md#licensing) and no longer requires an add-on license.

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Settings > Cloud apps > App governance > Service status** to either enable app governance if available, or sign up for the waitlist. 

Existing holders of trial licenses for the app governance add-on have until **July 31, 2023** to enable the toggle and retain their app governance access. 

For more information, see:

- [App governance Defender for Cloud Apps in Microsoft 365 Defender](app-governance-manage-app-governance.md)
- [Turn on app governance for Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](app-governance-get-started.md).

### App governance OAuth convergence

For customers who've enabled app governance, we've consolidated monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities for all OAuth apps in app governance. 

In the Microsoft 365 Defender portal, we've merged all capabilities originally under **Cloud apps > OAuth apps under  App governance**, where you can manage all OAuth apps under a single pane of glass.

For more information, see [View your apps](app-governance-visibility-insights-view-apps.md).

### Enhanced hunting experience for OAuth app activities

App governance now makes it easy for you to take hunting with app data to the next level by providing deeper OAuth app insights, helping your SOC identify an app’s activities and the resources it has accessed.

OAuth app insights include:

- Out-of-the-box queries that help to streamline the investigation
- Visibility into the data using the results view
- The ability to include OAuth app data such as resource, app, user, and app activity details in custom detections.

For more information, see [Hunt for threats in app activities](app-activity-threat-hunting.md).

### App hygiene update with  Microsoft Entra

Starting June 1, 2023, management of unused apps, unused credentials, and expiring credentials will only be available to app governance customers with Microsoft Entra Workload Identities Premium.

For more information, see [Secure apps with app hygiene features](app-governance-secure-apps-app-hygiene-features.md) and [What are workload identities?](/azure/active-directory/workload-identities/workload-identities-overview).

April 2, 2023

- New "behaviors" data type in Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting (Preview)  
To enhance our threat protection and reduce alert fatigue, we've added a new data layer called "behaviors" to the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps experience in Microsoft 365 Defender advanced hunting. This feature is intended to provide relevant information for investigations by identifying anomalies or other activities that may be related to security scenarios, but don't necessarily indicate malicious activity or a security incident. In this first stage, some of the Microsoft Defender for Cloud App anomaly detections will also be presented as behaviors. In future phases, these detections will only generate behaviors and not alerts. For more information, see [Investigate behaviors with advanced hunting (Preview)](behaviors.md).

## March 2023
### Defender for Cloud Apps release 249

March 19, 2023

- **Automatic redirection from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal (Preview)**  
A new automatic redirection toggle will allow you to trigger the automatic redirection from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to Microsoft 365 Defender. Once the redirection setting is enabled, users accessing the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps portal will be automatically routed to the Microsoft 365 Defender portal. The toggle default value is set to **Off**, and admins will need explicitly to opt in to the automatic redirection and start using the Microsoft 365 Defender exclusively. You still have an option to opt out from the Microsoft 365 Defender experiences and to use Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps standalone portal. This can be done by switching off the toggle. For more information, see [Redirecting accounts from Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps to Microsoft 365 Defender](/microsoft-365/security/defender/microsoft-365-security-mda-redirection).
