# Classic portal: Get started with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps

[!INCLUDE [Banner for top of topics](includes/classic-banner.md)]

This quickstart provides you with steps for getting up and running with Defender for Cloud Apps. Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps can help you take advantage of the benefits of cloud applications while maintaining control of your corporate resources. It works by improving visibility of cloud activity and helping to increase the protection of corporate data. In this article, we walk you through the steps you take to set up and work with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps.

## Prerequisites

- In order for your organization to be in compliance for licensing Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps, you must obtain a license for every user protected by Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. For pricing details, see the [Microsoft 365 licensing datasheet](https://aka.ms/M365EnterprisePlans).

    For activation support, see [Get support for Microsoft 365 for business](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support)

    >[!NOTE]
    >Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps is a security tool and therefore doesn't require Microsoft 365 productivity suite licenses. For Microsoft 365 Cloud App Security (Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps only for Microsoft 365), see [What are the differences between Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps and Microsoft 365 Cloud App Security?](editions-cloud-app-security-o365.md).

- After you have a license for Defender for Cloud Apps, you'll receive an email with activation information and a link to the Defender for Cloud Apps portal.

- To set up Defender for Cloud Apps, you must be a Global Administrator or a Security Administrator in Microsoft Entra ID or Microsoft 365. It's important to understand that a user who is assigned an admin role will have the same permissions across all of the cloud apps that your organization has subscribed to. This is regardless of whether you assign the role in the Microsoft 365 admin center, or in the Azure classic portal, or by using the Azure AD module for [Windows PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/assign-roles-to-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). For more information, see [Assign admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles) and [Assigning administrator roles in Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference).

- To run the Defender for Cloud Apps portal, use Internet Explorer 11, Microsoft Edge (latest), Google Chrome (latest), Mozilla Firefox (latest), or Apple Safari (latest).

## Step 1: Set instant visibility, protection, and governance actions for your apps

How to page: [Set instant visibility, protection, and governance actions for your apps](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md)

Required task: Connect apps

1. From the settings cog, select **App connectors**.
1. Select the plus sign (**+**) to add an app and select an app.
1. Follow the configuration steps to connect the app.

**Why connect an app?**
After you connect an app, you can gain deeper visibility so you can investigate activities, files, and accounts for the apps in your cloud environment.

## Step 2: Protect sensitive information with DLP policies

How to page: [Protect sensitive information with DLP policies](policies-information-protection.md)

Recommended task: Enable file monitoring and create file policies

1. Go to **Settings**, and then under **Information Protection**, select **Files**.
1. Select **Enable file monitoring** and then select **Save**.
1. If you use sensitivity labels from Microsoft Purview Information Protection, under **Information Protection**, select **Microsoft Information Protection**.
1. Select the required settings and then select **Save**.
1. In [Step 3](#step-3-control-cloud-apps-with-policies), create [File policies](data-protection-policies.md) to meet your organizational requirements.

> [!TIP]
> You can view files from your connected apps by browsing to **Investigate** > **Files**.

**Migration recommendation**  
We recommend using Defender for Cloud Apps sensitive information protection in parallel with your current Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) solution. Start by [connecting the apps you want to protect](enable-instant-visibility-protection-and-governance-actions-for-your-apps.md) to Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Since API connectors use out-of-band connectivity, no conflict will occur. Then progressively migrate your [policies](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md) from your current CASB solution to Defender for Cloud Apps.

> [!NOTE]
> For third-party apps, verify that the current load does not exceed the app's maximum number of allowed API calls.

## Step 3: Control cloud apps with policies

How to page: [Control cloud apps with policies](control-cloud-apps-with-policies.md)

Required task: Create policies

### To create policies

1. Go to **Control** > **Templates**.
1. Select a policy template from the list, and then choose (+) **Create policy**.
1. Customize the policy (select filters, actions, and other settings), and then choose **Create**.
1. On the **Policies** tab, choose the policy to see the relevant matches (activities, files, alerts).

> [!TIP]
> To cover all your cloud environment security scenarios, create a policy for each **risk category**.

### How can policies help your organization?

You can use policies to help you monitor trends, see security threats, and generate customized reports and alerts. With policies, you can create governance actions, and set data loss prevention and file-sharing controls.

## Step 4: Set up Cloud Discovery

How to page: [Set up Cloud Discovery](set-up-cloud-discovery.md)

Required task: Enable Defender for Cloud Apps to view your cloud app use

1. [Integrate with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](mde-integration.md) to automatically enable Defender for Cloud Apps to monitor your Windows 10 and Windows 11 devices inside and outside your corporation.
1. If you use [Zscaler, integrate](zscaler-integration.md) it with Defender for Cloud Apps.
1. To achieve full coverage, create a continuous Cloud Discovery report

    1. From the settings cog, select **Settings**.
    1. Under **Cloud Discovery**, choose **Automatic log upload**.
    1. On the **Data sources** tab, add your sources.
    1. On the **Log collectors** tab, configure the log collector.

**Migration recommendation**  
We recommend using Defender for Cloud Apps discovery in parallel with your current CASB solution. Start by configuring automatic firewall log upload to Defender for Cloud Apps [log collectors](discovery-docker.md). If you use Defender for Endpoint, in Microsoft Defender XDR, make sure you [turn on the option](mde-integration.md#how-to-integrate-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-with-defender-for-cloud-apps) to forward signals to Defender for Cloud Apps. Configuring Cloud Discovery won't conflict with the log collection of your current CASB solution.

### To create a snapshot Cloud Discovery report

Go to **Discover** > **Create snapshot report** and follow the steps shown.

### Why should you configure Cloud Discovery reports?

Having visibility into shadow IT in your organization is critical.
After your logs are analyzed, you can easily find which cloud apps are being used, by which people, and on which devices.

## Step 5: Deploy Conditional Access App Control for catalog apps

How to page: [Deploy Conditional Access App Control for catalog apps with Microsoft Entra ID](proxy-deployment-aad.md)

Recommended task: Deploy Conditional Access App Control for catalog apps

1. Configure your IdP to work with Defender for Cloud Apps. If you have Microsoft Entra ID, you can leverage inline controls such as *Monitor only* and *Block downloads* which will work for any catalog app out of the box.
1. Onboard apps onto access and session controls.
    1. From the settings cog, select **Conditional Access App Control**.
    1. Sign in to each app using a user scoped to the policy
    1. Refresh the **Conditional Access App Control** page and to view the app.
1. Verify the apps are configured to use access and session controls

To configure session controls for custom line-of-business apps, non-featured SaaS apps, and on-premises apps, see [Deploy Conditional Access App Control for custom apps using Microsoft Entra ID](proxy-deployment-any-app.md).

**Migration recommendation**  
Using Conditional Access App Control in parallel with another CASB solution can potentially lead to an app being proxied twice, causing latency or other errors. Therefore, we recommended progressively migrating apps and policies to Conditional Access App Control, creating the relevant session or access policies in  Defender for Cloud Apps as you go.

## Step 6: Personalize your experience

How to page: [Personalize your experience](mail-settings.md)

Recommended task: Add your organization details
